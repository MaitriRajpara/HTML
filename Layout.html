      In this example, we have created a header, two columns/boxes and a footer.
      On smaller screens, the columns will stack on top of each other.

        The articles in English are the definite article the and the indefinite
        articles a and an. They are the two most common determiners. The
        definite article is the default determiner when the speaker believes
        that the listener knows the identity of a common noun's referent
        (because it is obvious, because it is common knowledge, or because it
        was mentioned in the same sentence or an earlier sentence). The
        indefinite article is the default determiner for other singular,
        countable, common nouns, while no determiner is the default for other
        common nouns. Other determiners are used to add semantic information
        such as amount (many, a few), proximity (this, those), or possession
        (my, the government's).
